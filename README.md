# VEXT-Jetpack
Jetpack mod for Venice Unleashed

NOTE: This mod disables parachute, if you want to keep parachute, then you can remove Server/__init__.lua, but the jetpack experience will probably be worse.

<br>

**Config is in Shared/config.lua**
here you can tweak values to your liking.

you can for example make a moonjump like mod by changing accelleration so its below gravity constant.
Another thing you can do is have a max y height(map dependent), so you dont fly into space.
Also, you can remove max y velocity so you will go faster and faster upwards.

## Have fun
